# Single Cell Multiomics in Rice analysis code

**Accompanying code repository for the paper entitled: "A single-cell multiomics atlas of rice".**

## **Abstract**
Cell functions across eucaryotes are driven by specific gene expression programs that are dependent on chromatin structure. Here, we report a single-cell multiomics atlas of rice, one of the major crop plants. We simultaneously profiled chromatin accessibility and RNA expression in 116,564 cells from eight organs. We annotated the majority of cell types and identified cell-type expression programs, and found a high correlation between RNA and chromatin accessibility across cells. We constructed single-cell gene regulatory networks and co-expression networks, which allowed us to identify the cell type-specific regulators RSR1, F3H and LTPL120 in rice development. Furthermore, our analysis revealed a correlation between cell type and agronomic traits of rice, and the conserved and divergent functions of cell type during evolution. In summary, this study not only offers a valuable single-cell multiomics resource, but also enriches our understanding of the intricate roles and molecular underpinnings of individual cell types in rice.

# Scripts for single-cell multiomics analyses

This repository contains a series of scripts designed to handle various aspects of single-cell multiomics data analysis for rice. The scripts cover the entire workflow, including quality control, doublet removal, data integration, clustering, cell type annotation, differential expression analysis, motif and regulatory network analysis, and visualization. The analysis leverages tools like Seurat, Signac, DoubletFinder, Harmony, WGCNA, cellOracle and Monocle to process and interpret single-cell RNA-seq and ATAC-seq data. The outputs include UMAP visualizations, marker gene identification, pseudotime trajectory analysis, motif enrichment results, and cross-species comparisons, providing a comprehensive pipeline for single-cell multiomics studies in rice.
